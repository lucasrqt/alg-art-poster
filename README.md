# Algorithmic Art Poster Contest

This repository contains my work for the [contest of algorithmic art](https://bdepalme.fr/2024/09/22/poster.html) of the **[Palme association](https://bdepalme.fr)** (association of Computer Science students of ISTIC, University of Rennes).

## Installation

1. Create the virtual env. (see python doc, depends on the os)
2. Activate the virtual env.
3. Install the requierements :
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Play with the notebook

Everything is in the notebook `notebook.ipynb`.

### Steps

The goal is to get an image modified to get a psychedelic effect on it.

To do so I manipulate the images with the library opencv and I apply effects on it with numpy functions and the packages noise that provides useful functions to apply generative effects.
